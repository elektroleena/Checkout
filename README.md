# Checkout
This is a project I worked on as part of my studies at FH Technikum Wien.
It is possible to enter initials of people that want to checkout at a supermarket.
They form a queue and each of them can be assigned to one of two checkouts.
The people can then be checked out at the chosen checkout.
The programme consists three linked lists, one for the queue and one for each checkout.
